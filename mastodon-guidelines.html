<h1>Usage Guidelines for mastodon.gamedev.place</h1>

<p><em class="small">See also: <a href="mastodon-coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</em></p>


<h2>Who is mastodon.gamedev.place for?</h2>

<p>Game developers and people interested in game development!
<ul>
	<li>All specialities: artists, designers, engineers, ops, support, testers, ...</li>
	<li>All experience levels: beginners, students, hobbyists, professionals, experienced people, ...</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The expectation is that people on this instance will be game developers or somehow related to
that area. So you can expect the local timeline to be a lot of things related to game art, culture,
design, ideas, technology, planning, prototyping, development, shipping, supporting, etc.
</p>

<p>You can also write about other things too! Also you can use Mastodon's post publicity options
(posts visible everywhere; visible but not in search; only to followers etc.) if you're writing about
something that you think might be off-topic.</p>

<p>
There are things that are <b>disallowed</b> here: see <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/about/more">Server Rules</a>
and <a href="mastodon-coc.html">Code of Conduct</a> <em>(TL;DR: be a sensible, nice human being)</em>.
</p>


<h2>Why does this exist? What's the point?</h2>

<p><em>Good question!</em></p>

<p>Seems that in year 2017, Quite Many (tm) people got a bit upset with Twitter for various reasons.
It can be an unwelcoming, annoying, depressing or flat out dangerous environment for some. After I
(<a href="https://aras-p.info/">Aras Pranckevičius</a>) saw a sentiment of "let's do <em>another</em>
twitter-like thing for game developers, without all the twitter bullshit" repeated a few times,
I decided to spin up this <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> instance.</p>

<p>My own annoyances with Twitter: bots, spam, trolls, ads, twitter-the-company messing around with my timeline.
These are all fairly minor (I haven't experienced serious harrassment etc.); it could be much worse for
others.
</p>

<p>So that's the main point: a smaller, no-{insert bad things} twitter-like community about game development.</p>

<p>
Now of course, a "smaller twitter" has downsides too; by definition it is <em>smaller</em> and has less
people to interact with, and being game-development specific, has somewhat less topics being talked about.
It's a good idea for peace of mind and cultivating your existing interests; it's probably not a good
place for getting new interests, expanding your horizons or experiencing wildly different points of view.
YMMV!</p>


<h2>Who runs this? How long will you run it? Can I trust you?</h2>

<p>I'm <a href="https://aras-p.info/">Aras Pranckevičius</a>; a programmer by trade. Been ages since I worked
on actual game production, but I did spend many years working on <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>
game engine; you might have heard about it.
</p>

<p>
I intend to keep this running as long as it seems to be useful. This isn't facebook or twitter; there's no
huge live-ops team making the whole thing run smoothly though. The server might get hammered at times;
or it might have an hour or two downtime when software upgrades are done. The actual hosting &amp; administration of
Mastodon software is done by <a href="https://masto.host">masto.host</a> people; we'll try to keep operation
as smooth as possible. But again, hiccups might occur once in a while. Be patient; also... it's only a social network :)
</p>

<p>
I'm paying for the server costs myself; that's fine, I'm <em><b>not</b></em> looking for any help/crowdfunding/whatever in
that area.
</p>

<p>
Whether you can trust me (and other moderators) to be welcoming and just? I don't know,
your call. I'll try my best to be.
</p>
